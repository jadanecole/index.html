  <h1>My Doberman</h1>

  <p>
    The Doberman breed is known to be one of the smartest and most agile.
    These pups are full of energy and <strong>all</strong> muscle.
    They come in a few different shades, 
    <ul> 
      <li>black and rust</li>
      <li>red and rust</li>
      <li>blue and rust</li>
      <li>fawn</li>
    </ul>
    but <em>my</em> baby is red.

  Dobies are known to be wonderful family dogs, because they are so intellegent and easy to train. Their unique build is what makes
  them most intimidating and feared. However, those who own one will tell you that they're merely gentle giants
