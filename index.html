  <h1>My Favorite Dog</h1>

  <p>
    The Doberman Pinscher is widely recognized as one of the most intelligent and agile breeds.
    These dogs are <strong>all</strong> muscle and full of energy. No matter the hour, Dobermans 
    are ready for action; whether that action is training, running, or guarding. Known for their eagerness to learn and easy ability to train, they make well-rounded family dogs.
  Their unique build and intense appearance have often given them the reputation for being intimidating or even dangerous.
  However, any Dobie owner will tell you the honest truth; which is that behind that serious look is a loyal, affectionate, 
  drama-queen who just wants attention and <strong>will</strong> betray your trust for snacks. </p>
  <br>
    They come in a few different shades: 
    <ol> 
      <li>black and rust</li>
      <li>blue and rust</li>
      <li>red and rust</li>
      <li>fawn</li>
    </ol>

  <h2> A Brief History of the Doberman</h2>
<p> The Doberman Pinscher was created in the late 19th century by a tax collector called Karl Friedrich Dobermann, who wanted
  a protective companion to accompany him throughout his workday. By selectively breeding dogs known for strength, speed, and 
  trainability, he created a breed which quickly became of value to many different lines of work such as police work and military 
  services. Due to this very history, Dobermans are often associated with sharp instincts, fearlessness and protectiveness, making 
  them the exceptional working dogs.

  <h3> Drake</h3>
  <p> Despite the breed's reputation, <em> my</em> dobie missed the "intimidating protector" mark by a long shot! He runs into walls, 
    trips over his own giant feet, and does not possess a single defensive bone in his body. That said, he <em>will</em> however defend 
    me from squirrels, suspicious leaves, and any noise that dares to exist after 10 p.m. So, while he may not be a <em>scary looking 
    guard dog</em> with the cropped ears, I feel safe knowing that <strong>no</strong> squirrel will ever get the upper-hand.
